Vector3 Mastery is a 10-week course designed to help game developers increase their knowledge of one of the most important mathematical objects: vectors. Vectors permeate the mathematics of game development, perhaps most infamously in CFrames. We aim to explain the mathematics underpinning these objects while also guiding you through programming a practical linear algebra library for all your vector needs.

* **When:** Monday and Friday from 6pm--7pm PT, starting the week of May 29.
* **Where:** Voice chat on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Mpy5MwqeWc).
* **Who:** Lectures will be given by [Aidan (Darkson)](https://aidan-epperly.github.io/), a math PhD student, and [Ethan (AstroCode)](https://ecurtiss.dev), a 5th-year math undergrad.

## Course Structure

The course will run for 10 weeks with two lectures per week. Each week will focus on one topic, starting with a mathematical introduction to the subject and then proceeding to a hands on lesson in building a Roblox lua library to do the math for you. The first lecture each week will be taught by Aidan, who will focus on the mathematics, and the second will be taught by Ethan, who will focus on the code. Both lectures will cover the same topic but from different perspectives. That way, if you get behind, you should be able to catch up by attending the second lecture.
