title: Winter Mini Series - Approximation Theory
layout: single
---

Welcome to the RbxMath Winter Mini Series! This five-course mini series will focus on approximation theory. From the floats we use to approximate real numbers to the approximation techniques we use to compute the square root or sine function, the mathematics of approximation is everywhere in computing. We will explore five different aspects of approximation that come up all the time.

1. Floating point computation (Algebra 1)
2. Polynomial approximation (Algebra 2)
3. Spline interpolation (Precalculus)
4. Least square regression (Precalculus)
5. Numerical integration and differentiation (Precalculus)

All topics will be presented with as little reference to the background information as possible, but mathematical maturity comes with age and practice! All are welcome to attend regardless of background.
