The Robloxian Mathematical Society is a community of mathematicians on Roblox, welcoming folks from all mathematical backgrounds. To become a member, simply join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Mpy5MwqeWc). Here, you can discuss math, receive math help on your projects, and connect with fellow math enthusiasts.

## What we do
* **[Vector101](https://rbxmath.org/vector101):** A 10-week course teaching linear algebra to game developers. On now!
* **[RbxMath](https://github.com/rbxmath/rbxmath):** A fledgling repository of mathematical packages for Roblox development, written in [luau](https://luau-lang.org/) by members of our community.
* **Office Hours:** A weekly 1-hour period to get help, ask questions, or just chat about math with [Aidan](https://aidan-epperly.github.io/) and [Ethan](https://ecurtiss.dev/). Hosted via Discord voice chat on Saturdays at 1pm PT.

## Our friends
If you like our community, then you'll also like [metauni](https://metauni.org/)---a community of scholars in the metaverse. metauni hosts a weekly series of math and science seminars, and occasionally online courses, all within Roblox!
