# Welcome!
The Robloxian Mathematical Society is a community of mathematicians on Roblox, welcoming folks from all mathematical backgrounds. To become a member, simply join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Mpy5MwqeWc). Here, you can expect to discuss math, receive math help on your projects, and connect with follow math enthusiasts.

## RbxMath
[RbxMath](https://github.com/rbxmath/rbxmath) is a fledgling repository of mathematical packages written in [luau](https://luau-lang.org/) by members of our community.

## Office Hours
Office hours are hosted via Discord voice chat on most Thursdays at 8pm ET. This is a 1-hour period to get help, ask questions, or just chat about math with [Aidan](https://aidan-epperly.github.io/) and [Ethan](https://ecurtiss.dev/).

## metauni
If you like our community, then you'll also like [metauni](https://metauni.org/)---a community of scholars in the metaverse. metauni hosts a weekly series of math and science seminars, and occasionally online courses, all within Roblox.
